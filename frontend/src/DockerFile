# Step 1: Build the React app
FROM node:18 AS build

# Set the working directory

# Copy the rest of the project files

# Step 2: Serve the app using Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the build files from the previous step to the nginx public directory
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
